# Voice-Based-Gender-Classification-ML-Project-Project
This is a speech recognition project. The project aimed at identifying the gender from audio wave files containing the recorded voices (datasets). The features of the audio wave files were extracted using the librosa library and other data preprocessing tasks. 

The classification of the voices was performed using Support Vector Machine (SVM) and K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN) in some sort of comparative experimental study. SVM achieved 82% accuracy, while the KNN recorded 70% accuracy using the test set.
